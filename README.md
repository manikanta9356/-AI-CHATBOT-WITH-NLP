# AI Chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

An intelligent AI-powered chatbot capable of understanding and responding to human language using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project demonstrates how conversational AI can be developed using modern NLP frameworks and machine learning models.

## Features

- 🔍 Intent recognition and entity extraction
- 💬 Context-aware responses
- 🧠 Pre-trained language models (e.g., spaCy, BERT, or GPT-based)
- 🌐 Web-based chat interface (optional)
- 📚 Continuous learning and custom training support
- 🛠️ Modular architecture for easy integration with APIs and databases

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** / **spaCy** / **transformers**
- **Flask / FastAPI** (for the backend API)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for frontend if applicable)
- **Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch** (for model training)
- **MongoDB / SQLite** (optional for storing conversation history)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
If using a web interface, open index.html in your browser or run the frontend development server.

Example Usage
You can interact with the bot using the command line or a web interface. Sample inputs:

"What's the weather like today?"

"Book a table for two at 7 PM."

"Tell me a joke."

The chatbot parses the input, identifies intent, and generates a relevant response.

## How It Works
Text Preprocessing: Input is tokenized, normalized, and cleaned.

Intent Recognition: Classifies the user’s intent using an NLP model.

Entity Extraction: Detects relevant entities like dates, names, etc.

Response Generation: Chooses or generates an appropriate response.

Context Management: Maintains the context of the conversation.
